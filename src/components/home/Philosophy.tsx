              Rooted in a philosophy of quiet luxury, our garments are designed to speak
              softly in cut, in movement, in presence.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
              At Eclypse, we believe that true luxury isn't about shouting for attention,
              but about a whispered confidence that comes from impeccable craftsmanship,
              thoughtful design, and a deep commitment to quality.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Each piece is created with intention, designed to last beyond seasons and trends,
              becoming a treasured part of your evolving personal style story.
